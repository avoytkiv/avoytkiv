### Client Segmentation for targeted marketing in a credit union 

`Code`: [go to repo...](https://github.com/avoytkiv/credit-mlops)  
`Presentation`: [go to google slides...](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pDSZ51ej2VtzNydxAlhoLrQY95iydV-mELwKtUmL1QI/edit?usp=sharing)  
`Industry`: Banking and Finance
`Description`: The focus of the project was to build a highly flexible and automated ML pipeline to run experiments. Then, the best model is deployed to an app by a series of automated workflows.   
`Skills in focus`: Clustering, Model selection, Data and model versioning, Experimentations, CI/CD pipelines
`Tools`:
 - *Environment*: GitHub Codespaces, devcontainer, Docker, venv, Hydra
 - *Data Management*: DVC (Data Version Control), AWS S3
 - *DS and ML*: scikit-kearn (PCA, clustering algorithms), keras (autoencoder)
 - *Continuous Integration*: GitHub Actions, CML, AWS EC2
 - *Continuous Deployment*: Fast API, Heroku  

`Results`: This helps the credit union make better decisions about how to reach out to different groups of clients.  
`Status`: Completed in August 2023.
