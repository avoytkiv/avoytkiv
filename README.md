## Portfolio projects
> In this section I will list projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Client Segmentation for targeted marketing in a credit union

`Code`: [go to repo...](https://github.com/avoytkiv/credit-mlops)  
`Presentation`: [go to google slides...](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pDSZ51ej2VtzNydxAlhoLrQY95iydV-mELwKtUmL1QI/edit?usp=sharing)  
`Industry`: Banking and Finance   
`Description`: The focus of the project was to build a highly flexible and automated ML pipeline to run experiments. Then, the best model is deployed to an app by a series of automated workflows.   
`Skills in focus`: Clustering, Model selection, Data and model versioning, Experimentations, CI/CD pipelines   
`Tools`:
 - *Environment*: GitHub Codespaces, devcontainer, Docker, venv, Hydra
 - *Data Management*: DVC (Data Version Control), AWS S3
 - *DS and ML*: scikit-kearn (PCA, clustering algorithms), keras (autoencoder)
 - *Continuous Integration*: GitHub Actions, CML, AWS EC2
 - *Continuous Deployment*: Fast API, Heroku  

`Results`: This helps the credit union make better decisions about how to reach out to different groups of clients.     
`Status`: Completed in August 2023.

### Predicting job salary

`Code`: [go to repo...](https://github.com/avoytkiv/azml_predict_salary_nlp)   
`Description`: This is from Kaggle competition: "Adzuna wants to build a prediction engine for the salary of any UK job ad, so they can make huge improvements in the experience of users searching for jobs, and help employers and jobseekers figure out the market worth of different positions."   
`Data`: large dataset (hundreds of thousands of records), which is mostly unstructured text, with a few structured data fields.   
`Skills in focus`: Regression, Tokenization, Categorical Vectorization, Neural Networks, OOP, ML Pipeline (Azure CLI), Components (Azure CLI), Deployment       
`Tools`:
 - *Environment*: GitHub Codespaces, devcontainer, conda, Azure CLI, Azure ML Studio
 - *DS and ML*: PyTorch, scikit-learn   

`Status`: Completed in September 2023.   

### Predicting diabetes on Azure ML with GitHub Actions

`Code`: [go to repo...](https://github.com/avoytkiv/azml-github_actions-cicd)  
`Industry`: Healthcare   
`Description`:   
`Skills in focus`:  Logistic Regression, CI/CD pipelines, Linting, Testing, Package and Register the Model   
`Tools`:
 - *Environment*: GitHub Codespaces, devcontainer, Docker, venv
 - *Data Management*: Azure ML Datastore
 - *DS and ML*: scikit-kearn (Logistic regression)
 - *Continuous Integration*: GitHub Actions, Azure ML Resources (Job, Compute, Environment), flake8, pytest
 - *Continuous Deployment*:  MLFlow

`Results`: An automated workflow that will be triggered when a new model is registered. Once the workflow is triggered, the new registered model will be deployed to the production environment.   
`Status`: Completed in October 2023.
